This thing is called the Model 8741.
We have two of them.
One of them is connected to a box with three ethernet connections to the stage, and those are A, B, and C corresponding to the X, Y, and Z directions.
The other is connected to only two of them: A' and B', which are connected to thetaX and thetaY, respectively.

This Labview code was made in Labveiw 2009, but we have Labview 2016 so we might have to edit some stuff.

Current plan is to figure out how this code works and then integrate it to our DAQ code.
